# Parallel-word-search-using-open-mp
Accelerate your word searches with OpenMP! This project utilizes parallel processing to scan documents for keywords significantly faster than traditional methods. Ideal for large datasets and improving efficiency.
Word search searches for words in multiple text files parallelly using openmp concepts. Thisreduces the execution time of the code as compared to the sequential word search. 
The documents are scanned word by word and a dictionary is maintained so that words can be
searched. Since documents can have several thousands of terms scanning each term can take a lot
of time and hence there is a lot of scope for parallelization. The purpose of this project to
analysis which word search method is efficient to handle the multiple files. The conclusion of
this project will give us the sufficient reasons to choose the method. This could be helpful for
future word searing engines.
